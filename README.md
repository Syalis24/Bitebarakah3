## ✅ Vulnerability Scan Report (ZAP)
- Tool: OWASP ZAP vX.X.X
- Target: http://127.0.0.1:8000
- Result: [Summary of ZAP results]
- Before Fixes
    🟠 Medium Risk (2 alerts)
    1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
        - Description: Missing CSP headers means browsers have no restrictions on where content (e.g., JS, fonts, CSS) can be loaded from. This increases risk of XSS and code injection.
        - Pages Affected: /login, /register, /home, /forgot-password, /sitemap.xml
        - Fix suggestion: Add a Content-Security-Policy header in your Laravel middleware.

    2. Missing Anti-clickjacking Header (X-Frame-Options)
        - Description: Your site doesn’t block iframe embedding, making it vulnerable to clickjacking.
        - Pages Affected: /login, /register, /home, /forgot-password
        - Fix suggestion: Add X-Frame-Options: DENY or use CSP frame-ancestors 'none';.

    🟡 Low Risk (5 alerts)
    1. Big Redirect Detected
        - Description: Large redirect responses may unintentionally leak sensitive information in the response body.
        - Pages Affected: /, /login, /register, /home, /forgot-password
    2. Cookie Missing HttpOnly Flag
        - Description: Cookies without HttpOnly are accessible to JavaScript, increasing risk of session hijacking.
        - Fix suggestion: Ensure cookies are set with HttpOnly.
    3. Cross-Domain JS File Inclusion
        - Description: External scripts (like Google Fonts or JSCDN) were loaded without CSP restrictions.
        - Fix suggestion: Use CSP to restrict allowed JS origins.
    4. Server Leaks Info via X-Powered-By Header
        - Description: This header exposes technology stack info (e.g., PHP), which helps attackers.
        - Fix suggestion: Remove this header in Laravel or your server config.
    5. Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header
        - Description: Without this, browsers may attempt MIME-type sniffing, which can lead to XSS.
        - Fix suggestion: Set X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff.

    ℹ️ Informational (3 alerts)
    1. Authentication Request Identified
        - ZAP detected login forms on the site.
    2. Session Management Response Identified
        - Session tokens were found in responses (normal for login systems).
    3. User-Agent Fuzzing
        - No exploit found, just ZAP testing different user-agents.

## 🔒 Rubric-based Security Enhancements

### 🧾 RUBRICS 1–4 (Handled by Umar)
### 🧾 Rubric 1: Input Validation

**Before:**  
- OrderController accepted raw input without any validation.
- Login and registration inputs lacked strict type/format enforcement.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Applied strict validation rules using Laravel's `$request->validate()` function.
- Enforced email formatting (`rfc`, `dns`), input length limits, and regex-based password complexity.

**Code:**

`LoginRequest.php`:
```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'email' => ['required', 'string', 'email:rfc,dns', 'max:255'],
        'password' => ['required', 'string', 'min:8'],
    ];
}
```
`RegisteredUserController.php`:
```php
$request->validate([
    'name' => 'required|string|max:100',
    'email' => 'required|email:rfc,dns|max:255|unique:users,email',
    'password' => [
        'required',
        'string',
        'min:8',
        'confirmed',
        'regex:/[A-Z]/',      // uppercase
        'regex:/[a-z]/',      // lowercase
        'regex:/[0-9]/',      // digit
        'regex:/[@$!%*#?&]/', // special character
    ],
]);
```
`OrderController.php`:
```php
$request->validate([
    'customer_name' => 'required|string|max:100',
    'dessert_type' => 'required|string|in:Cake,Pie,Tart,Pudding',
    'dessert_item' => 'required|string|max:100',
    'quantity' => 'required|integer|min:1|max:50',
]);

```
---
### 🧾 Rubric 2: Error Handling & Information Disclosure

**Before:**  
- APP_DEBUG=true risked exposing internal error messages and stack traces.
- No custom error views existed for 404 or 500 responses.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Disabled debug mode in production via .env
- Used Handler.php to show custom views for errors
- Created user-friendly 500.blade.php and 404.blade.php

**Code:**

`.env`:
```php
APP_DEBUG=false
```
`Handler.php`:
```php
public function render($request, Throwable $exception)
{
    if (app()->environment('production')) {
        $status = method_exists($exception, 'getStatusCode') ? $exception->getStatusCode() : 500;
        return response()->view("errors.$status", [], $status);
    }

    return parent::render($request, $exception);
}

```
`resources/views/errors/500.blade.php`:
```php
<h1>Something went wrong</h1>
<p>We're sorry, but an unexpected error occurred.</p>
```
---
### 🧾 Rubric 3: Password Storage

**Before:**  
- Passwords were hashed using Laravel default (bcrypt), which is secure but not the strongest available.

**Fix Implemented:**
- Passwords securely hashed via Hash::make()
- Hashing algorithm upgraded to argon2id (memory-hard, GPU-resistant)

**Code:**

`RegisteredUserController.php`:
```php
'password' => Hash::make($request->password),
```
`config/hashing.php`:
```php
'default' => 'argon2id',
```
---
### 🧾 Rubric 4: Password Policies

**Before:**  
- No password complexity rules
- No lockout mechanism on failed logins

**Fix Implemented:**
- Applied strict complexity rules via regex in validation
- Enabled Laravel's rate limiter to block after 5 failed login attempts (1 min delay)

**Code:**

`Password validation (RegisteredUserController.php)`:
```php
    'password' => [
        'required',
        'string',
        'min:8',
        'confirmed',
        'regex:/[A-Z]/',      // uppercase
        'regex:/[a-z]/',      // lowercase
        'regex:/[0-9]/',      // digit
        'regex:/[@$!%*#?&]/', // special character
    ],
```
`Login rate limiting (LoginRequest.php)`:
```php
if (! RateLimiter::tooManyAttempts($this->throttleKey(), 5)) {
    return;
}
// Lockout occurs after 5 attempts
```
---
### 🧾 RUBRICS 5-8 (Handled by Afzal)
### ✅ Rubric 5: Authentication – Session Management

**Explanation:**

Laravel ensures strong session management by:
- Regenerating session IDs after login (prevents session fixation)
- Auto-expiring sessions after a defined timeout
- Securing cookies with `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite` flags

**Code:**

```php
// app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php
$request->session()->regenerate();

// .env
SESSION_LIFETIME=60

// config/session.php
'secure' => env('SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE', true),
'http_only' => true,
'same_site' => 'lax',
```
---

### ✅ Rubric 6: Authentication – Multi-Factor Authentication

**Explanation:**

To enhance security, 2FA (Time-based One-Time Password) was added for admin users using the pragmarx/google2fa package.
Admins can enable 2FA from a dedicated page, generating a secret key and recovery codes. These can be used with apps like Google Authenticator.

**Code:**
```php
// Enable 2FA: routes/web.php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use PragmaRX\Google2FA\Google2FA;

Route::post('/admin/2fa/enable', function () {
    $user = auth()->user();
    $user->forceFill([
        'two_factor_secret' => encrypt((new Google2FA)->generateSecretKey()),
        'two_factor_recovery_codes' => encrypt(json_encode(
            collect(range(1, 8))->map(fn () => Str::random(10))->all()
        )),
    ])->save();

    return back()->with('status', '2FA enabled. Store your recovery codes.');
})->middleware(['auth', 'is_admin'])->name('admin.2fa.enable');

<!-- View: resources/views/admin/2fa.blade.php -->
@if (auth()->user()->two_factor_secret)
    <p>✅ 2FA is enabled</p>
    <form method="POST" action="{{ route('admin.2fa.disable') }}">
        @csrf
        <button type="submit">Disable 2FA</button>
    </form>
@else
    <form method="POST" action="{{ route('admin.2fa.enable') }}">
        @csrf
        <button type="submit">Enable 2FA</button>
    </form>
@endif
```

### ✅ Rubric 7: Authorization – Default Permissions

**Explanation:**

Basic access control is enforced:

-Guests are redirected to the registration page.

-Only authenticated users can access /home.

-Non-admin users trying to access admin routes are shown a 403 Forbidden page.

**Code:**
```php
// web.php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return Auth::check() ? redirect('/home') : redirect()->route('register');
});

Route::get('/home', function () {
    return view('home');
})->middleware('auth')->name('home');

// Inside controller
if (!auth()->check() || !auth()->user()->is_admin) {
    abort(403); // Forbidden access
}
```
---

### ✅ Rubric 8: Authorization – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Explanation:**

Access to admin routes is protected based on roles:

-An is_admin column is added to the users table

-Middleware is_admin is used to protect sensitive admin routes

-Only users with is_admin = 1 can access these routes

**Code:**
```php
// Migration
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->boolean('is_admin')->default(false);
});

// Middleware: app/Http/Middleware/IsAdmin.php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
{
    if (!auth()->user()->is_admin) {
        abort(403);
    }

    return $next($request);
}

// Route group with middleware
Route::middleware(['auth', 'is_admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin', [AdminController::class, 'index'])->name('admin.index');
    Route::get('/admin/orders', [AdminController::class, 'viewOrders'])->name('admin.orders');
});
```
---

**How to Test**

-✅ Log in as a normal user → access to /home ✅ but access to /admin ❌ (403) (Rubric 7: Authorization – Default Permissions)

-✅ Log in as an admin user (is_admin = 1 in DB) → access to /admin ✅ (Rubric 8: Authorization – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC))

-✅ Go to /admin/2fa → enable 2FA and scan with Google Authenticator (Rubric 6: Authentication – Multi-Factor Authentication)

-✅ Session auto-expires after timeout (SESSION_LIFETIME), and regenerates on login (Rubric 5: Authentication – Session Management)

---
### 🧾 RUBRICS 9-13 (Handled by Afiff)
### ✅ Rubric 9: Browser Security Principles (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention)
- All user-supplied data displayed in the browser is contextually encoded. Content Security Policy (CSP) is implemented.

**XSS Prevention:**
I used Blade’s default escaping syntax {{ $variable }} instead of {!! !!} to ensure all user-supplied data is encoded before displaying it in the browser.

✅ Implemented in views like profile.blade.php, dashboard.blade.php, and order.blade.php.
**Code:**
```php
<x-app-layout>
    <x-slot name="header">
        <h2 class="font-semibold text-xl text-gray-800 leading-tight">
            {{ __('Dashboard') }}
        </h2>
    </x-slot>

    <div class="py-12">
        <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
            <div class="bg-white overflow-hidden shadow-sm sm:rounded-lg">
                <div class="p-6 text-gray-900">
                    {{ __("You're logged in!") }}

                    <!-- ✅ Safely show user's name -->
                    <p>Welcome, {{ Auth::user()->name }}</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</x-app-layout>
```

### ✅ Rubric 10. Browser Security Principles (Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention)
- Anti-CSRF tokens (synchronizer tokens) are used for all state-changing requests. SameSite cookies are properly configured.

**CSP (Content Security Policy):**
I added the ContentSecurityPolicy middleware to enforce a strict CSP policy. This helps to mitigate XSS by only allowing scripts/styles from trusted sources.

✅ Implemented in app/Http/Middleware/ContentSecurityPolicy.php and registered in Kernel.php.
**Code:**
```php
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ContentSecurityPolicy
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        $response = $next($request);

        $response->headers->set('Content-Security-Policy', "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; object-src 'none';");

        return $response;
    }
}
```
CSRF Protection:
All forms include @csrf to protect against CSRF attacks by generating synchronizer tokens. Laravel handles token validation automatically.
✅ Applied in all form views like order.blade.php.

**Code inserted**
```php
\App\Http\Middleware\ContentSecurityPolicy::class,
```
---
### ✅ Rubric 11. Database Security Principles (SQL Injection Prevention)
- All database queries use parameterized statements, prepared statements, or ORM frameworks that prevent SQL injection.

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
Laravel uses Eloquent ORM to interact with the database. This means all queries are automatically parameterized and protected from SQL injection.
✅ Used in User model and controllers that access user data.

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
And then:

class User extends Authenticatable
➡️ Authenticatable itself extends Eloquent's base model, which means your User model is an Eloquent model.

---
### ✅ Rubric 12. Database Security Principles (Database Access Control)
- Database users have the principle of least privilege applied; application connects with minimal required permissions.

**Database Access Control:**
The application connects to the MySQL database using the .env file. I ensured the database user in .env only has minimal privileges (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE).
✅ Used default .env config and did not grant full/root access.

---
### ✅ Rubric 13. File Security Principles (File Access Control)
- File and directory permissions follow the principle of least privilege, restricting access to only necessary users/processes. User input is never directly concatenated into file paths.

**File/Directory Access Control:**
I ensured storage, .env, and backend files are not accessible publicly by:

Only exposing the public/ folder via the web server (Apache).

DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/your-laravel-project/public"
<Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/your-laravel-project/public">

Setting proper permissions on sensitive files.
✅ Followed Laravel’s default .gitignore which excludes sensitive files from being pushed.

**Avoided Dangerous File Paths:**
I did not concatenate user input into file paths directly. All file uploads (if any) use Laravel’s built-in methods to handle file names securely.
✅ Ensured no dynamic path injection from user input.

---
